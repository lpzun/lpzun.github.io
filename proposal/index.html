    <h3>1. Thesis Proposal<br></h3>
    <p class="indented">
      <a href="">Resource-Parameterized Program Analysis using Observation Sequences</a>
    </p>
    <h4 class="indented">Abstract:</h4>
    <p class="indented">
      Most programs are naturally designed over a variable number
      of <i>discrete resources</i>, which can be either physical
      components like threads or logical entities like context
      switches. Such a resource is typically parametric, where the
      value of the parameter varies across different execution
      environments and is unknown at design time. We call such
      programs <i>resource-parameterized</i>. Although highly desirable,
      formally analyzing resource-parameterized programs for various
      error conditions is notoriously hard or even
      undecidable. Some existing research imposes bounds on certain
      resources, such as the number of available execution threads or
      thread contexts, to tackle the intractability or sidestep the
      undecidability of the analysis. This leads to a series of
      incomplete techniques that are believed to catch “most bugs” in
      practice. The question whether these techniques can also <i>prove</i>
      the absence of bugs, however, has remained largely open. 
    </p>
    <p class="indented">
      We address this question by introducing a broad verification
      methodology, the paradigm of <i>observation sequences</i>, for
      resource-parameterized programs. The verification is conducted by
      observing how changes to the resource parameter affect the behavior of
      the considered program. Applied to the undecidable problem of
      context-parameterized analysis for procedural concurrent programs, the
      paradigm results in partial verification techniques: they may not
      terminate, but are able to both refute and prove safety for concurrent
      recursive threads. Experiments have shown the effectiveness of our
      techniques. The paradigm of observation sequences is designed with
      generality in mind. In this proposal, we plan to explore two more
      instances: one is the <i>queue-parameterized analysis</i> for message-passing
      programs which communicate via queued messages; the other is
      <i>access-parameterized analysis</i> for shared-memory multithreaded
      programs. Both generalizations are supported by tool development and
      empirical evaluation.
